Scripture
=========

This repo contains a bunch of random scripts I've written/found useful at some
point in my life. Most (hopefully) will have a comment explaining the usage
and point of the script at the top under the shebang, and complicated scripts
should provide a usage message if run without arguments.

I've tried to organize them into a heirarchy based on genre.

* hacking/      -At the moment mostly just wifi sniffing
* net/          -Setting up/managing networks
* x/            -Various X11 utilities
